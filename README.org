* The Plan
** Lexer
   Read color blocks from file.
*** DONE Write image reader
*** DONE Write block lexer
** Parser
   Create AST from color blocks, high-level representation of operations
   performed at transitions between color blocks.
*** TODO Resolve white block problem
    Unlike other colors of blocks, white block behavior is dependent on the
    actual cursor coordinates. Luckily, this behavior can be determined at
    compile time!
** Codegen
   Emit an LLVM IR function for each color block.
*** TODO Create a constant vector/array for colors
    The ~nextBlock()~ function needs to know the current block's color. I should
    just make a global constant vector for block colors.
